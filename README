eTMB Score Calculation

The TMB score for a given set of variants and ROI size can be calculated with the "generate_TMB_score.R" script. 

Usage: 
    Rscript generate_TMB_score.R --input-variants=variants.txt --roi_size 1200000 

Inputs:
    1. --input-variants: file with pre-filtered variants following formatting specifications (see below)
    2. --roi_size: size of coding ROI, in base pairs.  The coding ROI is the size of all exonic regions of interest in the targeted panel.

Input variant file specifications:

The input variant file should be formatted as a tab-delimited text file with the following required fields:
    1. mut_reads: number of reads supporting the variant
    2. total_reads: number of wild type + mutant reads aligning to the genomic position of the variant
    3. variant_allele_fraction: fraction of total reads supporting the variant (mutant_reads / total_reads)
    4. coding_noncoding: predicted variant consequence summarized as "coding" or "noncoding".
        In the eTMB assay, synonymous and nonsynonymous variants as well as indels occurring in coding ROIs are considered "coding"
    5. germline_status: Annotation on whether variant is predicted to be germline.  Allowed values are "germline" and "not_germline".
        The eTMB assay uses a combination of the dbSNP, ExAC, gnomAD, and custom databases to populate this annotation
    6. hotspot_status:  Annotation on whether the variant is a hotspot in cancer.  Allowed values are "hotspot" and "non_hotspot". eTMB uses 
        the COSMIC database for this annotation
    7. quality_pass_fail: variant passes or fails quality filters, such as mapping quality.  Allowed values are "pass" and "fail"
    8.- Other fields are allowed as desired, without any requirement for header name or content.  These will not be used for the TMB score calculation.

Output:

    The script will output two files:
    1. TMB_filtered_candidate_variants.txt - contains the filtered variants used to calculate the TMB score
    2. TMB_score.txt - lists the TMB score and number of filtered variants used to calculate the TMB score
