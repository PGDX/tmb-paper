eTMB Score Calculation

The TMB score for a given set of variants and ROI size can be calculated with the "generate_TMB_score.R" script. 

Usage: 
    Rscript generate_TMB_score.R --input_variants=TMB_high_example.txt --roi_size 1200000 

    Running this script should take less than 5 seconds and will produce the files as below.  
    The TMB_filtered_candidate_variants.txt will have 132 variants and the TMB_score.txt should be 110.

Inputs:
    1. --input-variants: file with pre-filtered variants following formatting specifications (see below)
    2. --roi_size: size of coding ROI, in base pairs.  The coding ROI is the size of all exonic regions of interest in the targeted panel.

Input variant file specifications:

The input variant file should be formatted as a tab-delimited text file with the following required fields:
    1. mut_reads: number of reads supporting the variant
    2. total_reads: number of wild type + mutant reads aligning to the genomic position of the variant
    3. variant_allele_fraction: fraction of total reads supporting the variant (mutant_reads / total_reads)
    4. coding_noncoding: predicted variant consequence summarized as "coding" or "noncoding".
        In the eTMB assay, synonymous and nonsynonymous variants as well as indels occurring in coding ROIs are considered "coding"
    5. germline_status: Annotation on whether variant is predicted to be germline.  Allowed values are "germline" and "not_germline".
        The eTMB assay uses a combination of the dbSNP, ExAC, gnomAD, and custom databases to populate this annotation
    6. hotspot_status:  Annotation on whether the variant is a hotspot in cancer.  Allowed values are "hotspot" and "non_hotspot". eTMB uses 
        the COSMIC database for this annotation
    7. quality_pass_fail: variant passes or fails quality filters, such as mapping quality.  Allowed values are "pass" and "fail"
    8.- Other fields are allowed as desired, without any requirement for header name or content.  These will not be used for the TMB score calculation.

Output:

    The script will output two files:
    1. TMB_filtered_candidate_variants.txt - contains the filtered variants used to calculate the TMB score
    2. TMB_score.txt - lists the TMB score and number of filtered variants used to calculate the TMB score


System Requirements: 
    1. R software, available at https://www.r-project.org/.  This script was tested on version 3.6.2.
    2. The tidyverse package for R.  This script was tested on version 1.3.1.
    3. This software is compatible with Linux and macOS.


Installation:

No installation is required past the system requirements listed above.  
Expect 30 minutes - 1 hour for full installation if the R software and tidyverse packages are not already available on the system.
